Python implementation of bubble sort

From brilliant.org:

Bubble sort is a comparisonâ€‹-based algorithm that compares each pair of elements in an array and swaps 
them if they are out of order until the entire array is sorted. For each element in the list, the algorithm 
compares every pair of elements.
